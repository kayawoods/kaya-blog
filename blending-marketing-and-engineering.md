# ðŸ§  Blending Marketing and Engineering

Before I ever touched a codebase, I was deep in the world of growth. I built CRM workflows, wrote campaigns that moved people, and ran content across web, email, and SMS. I learned how to reverse-engineer decisions. I learned how to speak user.

That work taught me to think like a system. To look at every touchpoint as part of a journey â€” not just a message, but a map. It trained me to ask: whatâ€™s actually driving behavior here?

Now that Iâ€™ve built full-stack apps, I see things differently. I think in flowcharts and schemas. I notice every friction point. That backend logic? It shows up in my writing. It makes my content sharper, more honest, more useful.

Technical marketing isn't about buzzwords or feature lists. It's about knowing *how people move through a product*. It's about making the complex feel intuitive â€” without watering it down.

Whether I'm writing for developers or onboarding new users, my goal is the same: clarity with soul. Something that feels thoughtful, structured, and just human enough to land.

The more I code, the better I write. The more I write, the clearer I build.
