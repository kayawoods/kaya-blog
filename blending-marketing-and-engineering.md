# Blending Marketing and Engineering

Before I became a software engineer, I worked in growth marketing. I managed CRM workflows, wrote donor campaigns, and launched content across web, email, and SMS. That work sharpened my ability to think from the user’s perspective and reverse-engineer what makes people act.

Now that I’ve spent time building full-stack apps, my approach to content has changed. I see the backend logic behind every user interaction—and that insight helps me write with more clarity and intentionality. 

Technical marketing isn’t just about knowing how the product works. It’s about understanding *how people move through it*. It means making complex tools feel intuitive, thoughtful, and usable—without losing precision. Whether I’m writing for devs or end users, my job is to translate engineering logic into something that connects.

The more I code, the better I write. And the more I write, the clearer my code becomes.
