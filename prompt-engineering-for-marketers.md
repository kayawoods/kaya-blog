# Prompt Engineering for Marketers

Using AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude isn’t just about knowing what to ask—it’s about knowing how to structure your input so the model gives you what you actually need.

Here’s what I’ve learned while experimenting:

## 1. Be specific about the role and audience

❌ Bad: “Write an email about our new product.”  
✅ Better: “Act as a growth marketer. Write an email for first-time users explaining the value of our new automation feature. Keep it casual but clear, and include a CTA.”

## 2. Break the task into steps

Instead of:  
“Write a blog post about our Zapier integration.”

Try:  
- Step 1: Summarize the value of automating workflows for busy dev teams  
- Step 2: List 3 real use cases  
- Step 3: Include a quote or testimonial  
- Step 4: Add a CTA to try it

This helps the model build logic, not just spit out fluff.

## 3. Use successful prompts as templates

Once something works, save it. I have go-to templates for blog outlines, headlines, client emails, even LinkedIn captions. Good prompting is a system, not a one-off.

## 4. Choose the right model

GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini—they each respond differently. I test across tools depending on tone, speed, and reliability. Treat AI tools like teammates: play to their strengths.

Prompt engineering is a skill. The better you get at it, the more useful AI becomes.
