# 🤖 Prompt Engineering for Marketers

The more I work with AI, the more I realize it’s not about having the “right” prompt. It’s about knowing how to think through the problem and how to guide the tool like a creative partner.

Tools like GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini can be powerful, but only if you give them a clear path to follow. Here’s what’s helped me make them actually useful in real work: writing copy, planning campaigns, and brainstorming in weird little rabbit holes of thought.

## 1. Give the model a role and a reader

Whenever I’m stuck, I remember this: the model has no idea who it is or who it’s talking to. If you don’t say, it guesses. And that guess is usually vague.

So I’ll say:  
“Act as a growth marketer. Write an email for first-time users explaining the value of our new automation feature. Keep it casual but clear, and include a CTA.”

It’s like setting the stage. Once it knows the scene, it shows up better.

## 2. Break big asks into steps

The first time I asked for a blog post in one go, I got a pile of nonsense. The fix? Just take it slow.

Now I walk it through:

- Step 1: “Summarize the value of automating workflows for busy dev teams”  
- Step 2: “List 3 real use cases that sound specific, not generic”  
- Step 3: “Include a short testimonial quote”  
- Step 4: “Write a CTA that sounds confident, not pushy”

Suddenly the response feels built, not just generated.

## 3. Save your good prompts

I have a folder of prompts I reuse all the time. Blog outlines. Subject lines. Welcome emails. Even captions.

It helps to think of prompting as a system. Not a one-time ask, but a toolkit you can keep refining.

## 4. Know when to switch tools

Sometimes I’ll write with Claude when I want nuance. Sometimes I’ll use GPT-4o for smoother summaries. Sometimes Gemini is faster for brainstorming structure.

Each model has its vibe. If something feels off, I try another. Like swapping out a teammate, not starting from scratch.

I used to think prompting was about phrasing. But now I see it more like storyboarding. You give it a frame, a tone, and a reason to care. And when you do that well, it actually helps.
